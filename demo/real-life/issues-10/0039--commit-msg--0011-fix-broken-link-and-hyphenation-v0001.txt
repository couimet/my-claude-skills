[PR feedback] Fix broken link and compound-modifier hyphenation in README

CodeRabbit caught the intentional broken link in the Resources section
(`skill/README.md` instead of `skills/README.md`) along with two
compound-adjective hyphenation issues. All three are straightforward
grammar/correctness fixes.

Benefits:
- Resources link now resolves to the actual skills/README.md file
- "out-of-the-box" and "step-tracking" follow standard compound-modifier rules

Ignored Feedback:
- Demo snapshot files (0011, 0015, 0018, 0021, 0023, 0027): historical artifacts that must remain frozen-in-time
- Truncated A005 in question file 0005: authentic user response captured as-is
- Stale artifact count "29" in finish-issue scratchpad 0030: correct at time of capture
- Stray backtick in commit message 0034: actual git commit has the same typo, so the demo copy is accurate
