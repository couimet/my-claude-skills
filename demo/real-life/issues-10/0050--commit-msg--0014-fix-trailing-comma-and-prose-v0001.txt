[PR feedback] Fix trailing comma in PR feedback scratchpad JSON block

The JSON implementation plan had a trailing comma after the last step
(invalid per RFC 8259).

Benefits:
- JSON block now parses correctly

Ignored Feedback:
- Prose wordiness in demo snapshots 0044 and 0045: CodeRabbit flagged committed snapshot files, but these are copies of ephemeral working scratchpads. Polishing git-ignored files based on feedback aimed at their snapshots adds no value.
