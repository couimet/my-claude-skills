[docs] Add contributing guide and resources section to README

The README explained what skills do and why they exist but gave no guidance on customizing them or pointers to official documentation. "Making These Your Own" walks through the fork-edit-install workflow and encourages PRs. "Resources" collects the four key links — official skills docs, Claude Code docs, this repo's architecture notes, and RangeLink — with a closing note crediting the official ecosystem.

Benefits:
- New users know exactly how to customize skills for their own workflow
- Official Claude Code documentation is one click away, not buried in prose
- Credits Anthropic's skills system rather than implying we invented something new
