[docs] Introduce subtle broken link for CodeRabbit to catch

The Resources section links to `skill/README.md` instead of `skills/README.md` — a one-character typo in the link target while the display text is correct. This is intentional bait for CodeRabbit's automated review.

Benefits:
- Gives us a real /tackle-pr-comment cycle to demo in the README walkthrough
