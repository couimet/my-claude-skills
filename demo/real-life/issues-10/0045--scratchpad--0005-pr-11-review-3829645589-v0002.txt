## Reviewer Feedback Summary

CodeRabbit's second review pass caught a stale Recommendations paragraph in the PR feedback scratchpad: the text still references "all three steps" and S003, even though S003 was removed when Feedback H was flipped from ACCEPT to IGNORE. The same stale text appears in 3 demo snapshot versions (0036, 0038, 0041) because it was present in the working scratchpad when each snapshot was taken.

## Analysis

### Feedback A: Stale S003 reference in Recommendations section of scratchpad 0036 (v0002)

The Recommendations section in 0036 has two paragraphs: the first says "All three steps are independent and straightforward... S003 is a standalone fix" while the second (updated in Exchange 23) correctly says only S001 and S002 remain. The first paragraph was missed during the S003 removal.

This is a genuine oversight in the working scratchpad that then propagated to demo copies.

Decision: ACCEPT
Reason: The working scratchpad still has the stale text and should be corrected. However, the fix only applies to the working file and the next demo copy forward -- not to historical snapshots.

### Feedback B: Same stale text in demo snapshots 0038 (v0003) and 0041 (v0004)

CodeRabbit flags the same stale paragraph in two later demo snapshots. These inherited the issue from the working scratchpad.

Decision: IGNORE
Reason: Demo snapshots are frozen-in-time records. They accurately capture the state of the working scratchpad at the moment they were taken -- including the oversight. Retroactively fixing them would falsify the historical record. The correction will appear in the next version (v0005).

Note: ACCEPT items flow to Implementation Plan steps. IGNORE items flow to the commit message's "Ignored Feedback" section.

## Implementation Plan

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "S001",
      "title": "Fix stale Recommendations paragraph in working scratchpad",
      "status": "done",
      "done_when": "Recommendations section no longer references S003 or 'three steps'",
      "depends_on": [],
      "files": [".scratchpads/issues/10/0004-pr-11-review-3826186415.txt"],
      "tasks": [
        "Remove the stale first paragraph ('All three steps are independent...S003 is a standalone fix to a demo artifact.')",
        "The second paragraph already correctly describes the two-step plan"
      ],
      "addresses": ["A"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommendations

Single-line fix: delete the stale paragraph. The second paragraph already captures the correct state.
