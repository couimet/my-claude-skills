[PR feedback] Fix stale Exchange 28 narrative in TIMELINE.md

Exchange 28 still described the pre-correction plan ("All 4 items accepted,"
"Three steps: S001...S003") after we had corrected artifacts 0047-0050 to
reflect only 2 accepted items and 2 steps. Updated the narrative and artifact
description to match the corrected state.

Benefits:
- TIMELINE.md now accurately describes what the artifacts contain
- No cross-artifact inconsistencies remain

Ignored Feedback:
- Stale "pending" status in 0047 v0001: this is the intentional "before" state in our versioned artifact pairs, not a stale field.
- "11 items" count in demo snapshot 0048: frozen snapshot, not retroactively editable.
- "at each point in time" wordiness in demo snapshot 0048: frozen snapshot, same nitpick as previous review.
