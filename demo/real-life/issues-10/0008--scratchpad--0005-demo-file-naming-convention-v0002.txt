Demo File Naming Convention — Global Sequence + File-Placement Prefix + Version Suffix

Three naming issues to resolve before we start executing implementation steps.

## Issue 1: Missing file-placement category in demo filenames

The flat `demo/real-life/issues-10/` folder needs to be browsable without nested sub-folders. Currently, files like `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-0001.txt` don't tell you at a glance whether it's a scratchpad, question file, commit message, or breadcrumb. The `/file-placement` skill defines categories — we should surface that in the filename.

Categories from file-placement/SKILL.md:
- `scratchpad` — from `.scratchpads/`
- `question` — from `.claude-questions/`
- `commit-msg` — from `.commit-msgs/`
- `breadcrumb` — from `.breadcrumbs/`
- `readme` — special case for README.md snapshots (the actual deliverable)

Delimiter: double-dash (`--`) to visually separate category from filename without colliding with hyphens in slugs.

## Issue 2: Missing `v` prefix on version suffix

Without the `v`, a filename like `0001-readme-design-decisions-0001.txt` has two undifferentiated NNNN blocks. The `v` makes it instantly clear: file #0001, version v0001.

## Issue 3: Missing global chronological sequence

With only category + original-filename + version, the folder sorts by category (all questions together, all scratchpads together). This loses the chronological narrative. A global sequence number prepended to every artifact makes the folder a visual timeline that matches TIMELINE.md 1-for-1.

## Final naming pattern

```
<NNNN>--<category>--<original-filename>-v<NNNN>.<ext>
 ^         ^              ^               ^
 |         |              |               └─ version of this specific file
 |         |              └─ original skill-generated filename
 |         └─ file-placement category
 └─ global chronological sequence (matches TIMELINE.md)
```

TIMELINE.md itself has no prefix — it's the narrative spine, not an artifact snapshot. It is updated in place (never versioned) and every demo artifact maps to an entry in it.

## Chronological mapping of existing artifacts

| Global # | What happened | Demo filename |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | Claude created initial scratchpad (gap analysis + 8 suggestions) | `0001--scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt` |
| 0002 | Claude created 12 design questions (unanswered) | `0002--question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0001.txt` |
| 0003 | User answered all 12 questions | `0003--question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0002.txt` |
| 0004 | Claude created 5 demo follow-up questions (unanswered) | `0004--question--0002-demo-approach-v0001.txt` |
| 0005 | User answered demo follow-ups | `0005--question--0002-demo-approach-v0002.txt` |
| 0006 | Claude refined scratchpad with full implementation plan | `0006--scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0002.txt` |
| 0007 | Claude created this naming convention scratchpad | `0007--scratchpad--0005-demo-file-naming-convention-v0001.txt` |
| 0008 | Claude updated this scratchpad with global sequence | `0008--scratchpad--0005-demo-file-naming-convention-v0002.txt` |

### How it looks when sorted in the folder

```
0001--scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt
0002--question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0001.txt
0003--question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0002.txt
0004--question--0002-demo-approach-v0001.txt
0005--question--0002-demo-approach-v0002.txt
0006--scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0002.txt
0007--scratchpad--0005-demo-file-naming-convention-v0001.txt
0008--scratchpad--0005-demo-file-naming-convention-v0002.txt
TIMELINE.md
```

Reading top to bottom tells the full story chronologically. The category segment tells you what kind of artifact it is. The version suffix tells you which iteration of that specific file.

## TIMELINE.md contract

Every file in the demo folder (except TIMELINE.md itself) MUST have a corresponding entry in TIMELINE.md. Every interaction that produces or modifies a demo artifact updates TIMELINE.md. This is a hard rule — the folder listing and TIMELINE.md must always be in sync.

## What needs updating once approved

1. Rename the 6 existing files in `demo/real-life/issues-10/` to new convention
2. Add this scratchpad (v0001 = before global sequence, v0002 = after) as files 0007 and 0008
3. Update TIMELINE.md: fix artifact links, add Exchange 7 (naming convention discussion) and Exchange 8 (global sequence refinement)
4. Update .scratchpads/0004-readme-enrichment-plan.txt Demo Artifact Conventions section and S001 file list
