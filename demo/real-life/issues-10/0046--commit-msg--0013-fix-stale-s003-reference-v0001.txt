[PR feedback] Remove stale S003 reference from Recommendations section

When Feedback H was flipped from ACCEPT to IGNORE (removing S003), the
second Recommendations paragraph was updated but the first paragraph
still said "All three steps are independent... S003 is a standalone fix."
Deleted the stale paragraph; the remaining text correctly describes the
two-step plan.

Benefits:
- Recommendations section now matches the actual implementation plan

Ignored Feedback:
- Same stale text in demo snapshots 0036, 0038, 0041: these are frozen-in-time artifacts that accurately capture the oversight when each snapshot was taken
