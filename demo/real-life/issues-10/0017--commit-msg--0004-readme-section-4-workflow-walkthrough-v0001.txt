[docs] Add full workflow walkthrough with Mermaid lifecycle diagram

Readers could see individual skills in Quick Start but had no sense of how they compose into a complete issue lifecycle. The "See It In Action" section walks through the real flow — pre-planning with /question, branching with /start-issue, iterating with /tackle-scratchpad-block, and wrapping up with /finish-issue — linking every step to actual artifacts from this very issue.

Benefits:
- Mermaid diagram gives instant visual grasp of the skill lifecycle
- Walkthrough uses real artifacts, not fabricated examples
- Collapsible `<details>` blocks let curious readers dig deeper without cluttering the page
