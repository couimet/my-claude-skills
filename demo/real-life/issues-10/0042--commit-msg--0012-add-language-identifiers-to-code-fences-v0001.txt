[PR feedback] Add language identifiers to all fenced code blocks in README

CodeRabbit flagged 9 bare fenced code blocks missing language identifiers
(markdownlint MD040). All blocks contain plain text content (command
invocations, scratchpad excerpts, question file excerpts, commit messages)
so `text` is the appropriate identifier for each.

Benefits:
- GitHub renders syntax-highlighted blocks more consistently
- Screen readers can announce the content type for accessibility
- Passes markdownlint MD040 validation
