[PR feedback] Fix broken code spans in TIMELINE.md

Heading patterns like `### N. `/skill` — description` used single backticks,
but the inner backticks for `/skill` broke the code span rendering. Switched
to double backticks on lines 387, 409, 411, and 412.

Benefits:
- Code spans render correctly on GitHub instead of breaking mid-fragment
