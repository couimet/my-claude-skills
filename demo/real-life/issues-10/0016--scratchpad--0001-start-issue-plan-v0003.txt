# Issue #10: Add Meat to README

Type/Priority/Scope: documentation, enhancement

## Context

The landing README is 25 lines — clone, install, and a pointer to skills/README.md. It communicates nothing about what problem these skills solve, what using them feels like, or why someone would adopt them. The issue asks to "add meat" by pointing to official skills config references and adding a "how I work" section with real usage examples.

Through pre-planning (scratchpads 0004 and 0005, question files 0001 and 0002), the scope expanded into an "eat your own dog food" approach: we use this very issue's workflow as the demo, persisting all ephemeral artifacts in `demo/real-life/issues-10/` so readers can see the full skill lifecycle in action.

Key decisions (resolved in .claude-questions/0001-readme-design-decisions.txt and .claude-questions/0002-demo-approach.txt):
- Single comprehensive README, casual first-person voice, problem-statement opening
- Real artifacts from this conversation as the demo (no fabrication)
- Collapsible `<details>` blocks for inline depth
- Mermaid lifecycle diagram
- "What You Type" / "What Works Automatically" reference structure
- Philosophy section with RangeLink, crash-recovery, folder-org bullets
- demo/ folder with `<NNNN>--<category>--<original-filename>-v<NNNN>.<ext>` naming convention
- TIMELINE.md as narrative spine, 1:1 with demo folder contents

## Assumptions Made

- Issue #10 stays bare on GitHub (as stated in design decisions) — the demo shows the full workflow starting from that minimal issue.
- CodeRabbit is active on this repo and will review PRs automatically. If not, we adapt the /tackle-pr-comment demo using a rangeLink PR as reference (per user's suggestion).
- Pre-planning scratchpads (0004, 0005) and question files (0001, 0002) live at root `.scratchpads/` and `.claude-questions/` since they were created before the issue branch. This scratchpad and all future artifacts are scoped to `.scratchpads/issues/10/`.
- TIMELINE.md is updated after every exchange — it's the one file in demo/ that's modified in place rather than versioned.
- The README content references demo artifacts by their final filenames. Since we add artifacts incrementally and filenames include global sequence numbers, the README's "See It In Action" section may need a final pass to update links once all artifacts exist.

## Files to Modify

**S001-S004:** README.md (iterative rewrites)
**S005:** README.md (intentional error), then PR creation
**S006:** demo/real-life/issues-10/TIMELINE.md (finalization)

## Documentation & Discoverability

- [x] README update — this IS the README update
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry — not applicable (no code changes, documentation only)
- [ ] skills/README.md — may need minor updates if root README restructures the reference section
- [ ] install.sh — no changes needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README has all 8 sections: hook, install, quick start, full workflow, philosophy, reference, contributing, resources
- [ ] All demo artifacts in demo/real-life/issues-10/ follow the naming convention
- [ ] TIMELINE.md entries match demo folder contents 1:1
- [ ] Mermaid diagram renders correctly on GitHub
- [ ] Official Claude Code skills documentation is linked (inline + resources section)
- [ ] `<details>` blocks expand correctly on GitHub
- [ ] At least one /tackle-pr-comment cycle captured in demo/
