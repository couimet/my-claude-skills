Demo File Naming Convention — File-Placement Prefix + Version Suffix Fix

Two issues to resolve before we start executing implementation steps.

## Issue 1: Missing file-placement category in demo filenames

The flat `demo/real-life/issues-10/` folder needs to be browsable without nested sub-folders. Currently, files like `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-0001.txt` don't tell you at a glance whether it's a scratchpad, question file, commit message, or breadcrumb. The `/file-placement` skill defines 5 categories — we should surface that in the filename.

### Proposal

Prefix each demo artifact with its file-placement category, separated by a delimiter.

The categories from file-placement/SKILL.md:
- `scratchpad` — from `.scratchpads/`
- `question` — from `.claude-questions/`
- `commit-msg` — from `.commit-msgs/`
- `breadcrumb` — from `.breadcrumbs/`
- `timeline` — special case for TIMELINE.md (not a skill artifact, but the narrative spine)
- `readme` — special case for README.md snapshots (the actual deliverable)

### Delimiter options

A) Double-dash: `scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt`
B) Underscore: `scratchpad_0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt`
C) Dot prefix: `scratchpad.0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt`

Leaning toward A (double-dash) — it visually separates the category from the original filename without colliding with hyphens already in the slug or the single-underscore convention in some systems. Sorting groups files by category first, then by original name.

## Issue 2: Missing `v` prefix on version suffix

Decision in .claude-questions/0002-demo-approach.txt#L28 says NNNN suffix format, but we forgot the `v` prefix to distinguish the version number from the original NNNN file sequence number.

Current (wrong): `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-0001.txt`
Correct: `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt`

Without the `v`, a filename like `0001-readme-design-decisions-0001.txt` has two undifferentiated NNNN blocks — confusing. The `v` makes it instantly clear: `0001-readme-design-decisions-v0001.txt` → file #0001, version #0001.

## Combined naming pattern

```
<category>--<original-filename>-v<NNNN>.<ext>
```

## What the current demo/ files would become

| Current name | New name |
|---|---|
| `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-0001.txt` | `scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt` |
| `0004-readme-enrichment-plan-0002.txt` | `scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0002.txt` |
| `0001-readme-design-decisions-0001.txt` | `question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0001.txt` |
| `0001-readme-design-decisions-0002.txt` | `question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0002.txt` |
| `0002-demo-approach-0001.txt` | `question--0002-demo-approach-v0001.txt` |
| `0002-demo-approach-0002.txt` | `question--0002-demo-approach-v0002.txt` |
| `TIMELINE.md` | `TIMELINE.md` (no prefix needed — unique, always one file) |

### How it looks when sorted in the folder

```
question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0001.txt
question--0001-readme-design-decisions-v0002.txt
question--0002-demo-approach-v0001.txt
question--0002-demo-approach-v0002.txt
scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0001.txt
scratchpad--0004-readme-enrichment-plan-v0002.txt
TIMELINE.md
```

Files naturally group by category. Within each category, the original numbering and version suffix provide chronological order.

## What needs updating once approved

1. Rename the 6 existing files in `demo/real-life/issues-10/`
2. Update TIMELINE.md artifact links to use new names
3. Update .scratchpads/0004-readme-enrichment-plan.txt#L27-L38 (demo conventions and examples)
4. Update .scratchpads/0004-readme-enrichment-plan.txt#L63-L72 (S001 file list)
