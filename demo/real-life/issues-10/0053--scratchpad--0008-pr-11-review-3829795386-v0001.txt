# PR #11 Comment Response

## Reviewer Feedback Summary

CodeRabbit's fourth review pass found 4 items: a stale "pending" status in demo artifact 0047, an "11 items" vs "12 items" count discrepancy in demo artifact 0048, a stale Exchange 28 narrative in TIMELINE.md that still describes the pre-correction plan, and a repeated prose wordiness nitpick on a demo snapshot.

## Analysis

### Feedback A: Stale "pending" status in 0047 scratchpad v0001 (line 49)

CodeRabbit flags that S001's status is "pending" in 0047 but the Recommendations section says S001 is done. It suggests changing the status to "done."

Decision: IGNORE
Reason: 0047 is the v0001 copy -- the "before" state. It intentionally shows S001 as `pending` so the diff to v0002 (0049) reveals only the status transition to `done`. CodeRabbit sees v0001 in isolation and misreads the stale-looking status. The versioning convention is working as designed.

### Feedback B: "11 items" count discrepancy in 0048 (line 7)

CodeRabbit flags that the summary says "11 items" but the breakdown (1 broken link + 2 hyphenation + 9 code fences) sums to 12. It suggests fixing the count.

Decision: IGNORE
Reason: 0048 is a frozen demo snapshot of working scratchpad 0004. Frozen snapshots are historical records that capture the file as it existed at a point in time. Retroactively fixing them would falsify the chronological record.

### Feedback C: Stale Exchange 28 narrative in TIMELINE.md (~lines 535-537)

Exchange 28 still reads: "All 4 items accepted. [...] Three steps: S001 fixes trailing comma + prose in scratchpad 0004, S002 fixes prose in scratchpad 0005, S003 fixes code spans in TIMELINE.md." This describes the pre-correction plan. The corrected plan has only 2 items accepted (A and B), 2 ignored (C and D), and 2 steps (S001 trailing comma, S002 code spans). We updated artifacts 0047-0050 when altering the past but missed the TIMELINE narrative and artifact description.

Decision: ACCEPT
Reason: TIMELINE.md is a living document. Exchange 28's narrative must match the corrected artifacts it references. This is a genuine oversight from our "altering the past" work.

### Feedback D: "at each point in time" wordiness in 0048 (line 44)

Same prose nitpick as the previous review (Feedback C in scratchpad 0006). LanguageTool flags "at each point in time" as redundant.

Decision: IGNORE
Reason: Same as before -- 0048 is a frozen demo snapshot. Prose polish on historical records adds no value.

Note: ACCEPT items flow to Implementation Plan steps. IGNORE items flow to the commit message's "Ignored Feedback" section.

## Implementation Plan

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "S001",
      "title": "Fix stale Exchange 28 narrative in TIMELINE.md",
      "status": "pending",
      "done_when": "Exchange 28 reflects the corrected plan: 2 items accepted (A, B), 2 ignored (C, D), 2 steps (S001 trailing comma, S002 code spans), and artifact description no longer says 'all 4 items accepted'",
      "depends_on": [],
      "files": ["demo/real-life/issues-10/TIMELINE.md"],
      "tasks": [
        "Rewrite TIMELINE.md lines 535-537: replace 'All 4 items accepted' with accurate summary (A and B accepted, C and D ignored)",
        "Replace 'Three steps: S001...S003' with 'Two steps: S001 fixes trailing comma in scratchpad 0004, S002 fixes code spans in TIMELINE.md'",
        "Update artifact description on line 541: remove 'all 4 items accepted'"
      ],
      "addresses": ["C"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommendations

S001 is a straightforward text correction in TIMELINE.md. The other three items (A, B, D) are all correctly ignored: A misunderstands the versioning convention, B and D target frozen demo snapshots.
