[docs] Rewrite README with opening hook, installation, and quick start

The 25-line README communicated nothing about why someone would adopt these skills. The rewrite opens with the problem (unstructured Claude Code sessions, lost context, generic commits) and shows three foundation skills in action with real output from this repo's own workflow.

Benefits:
- Beginners see what each skill produces before they install anything
- Collapsible <details> blocks link to real demo artifacts, not fabricated examples
- Official Claude Code skills documentation linked inline for ecosystem context
